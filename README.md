Classification for MergeSort as nlog(n):

### Hypothesis:
The recursive MergeSort algorithm can be broken down into
levels, with each level representing a new series of recursive calls.

(level) [1 2 3 4]
(level) [1 2]  [3 4]
(level) [1]  [2]  [3]  [4]

The recursive calling will repeatedly call sort() on lists of half-size
until a size of one is reached. Thus the number of levels is log base 2
of n, much like the action in binary search, in which each pass acted on
half the size before it.

ex:
A list of 100 elements will require ~eight levels, with each level handling
lists of following size:
100, 50, 25, 13, 7, 4, 2, 1

Once the recursive calling has reached size 1 lists, it will be time to
return and slowly reconstitute the sorted list step-by-step. At each level, merge() must be called on pairs of pre-sorted lists. Merge() itself is linear based on the size of its two paramater lists. The number of times it is called will be halved each time a recursive call returns.

ex:
For a list of 100 elements
at 1 element list level, it will be called 50 times
at 2 element list level, it will be called 25 times
However, the number of elements merge() is handling doubles. In the end, the calls halve each level, but the n doubles. The result is that each recursive level is a linear function of n.

Because there are log(n) recursive levels each operating at linear n time, the overall efficiency is n * log(n).

### Analysis of Times:
This is the plot of the points and the lines of best fit using mx mx^2 and xlog(x).
From the plots, it appears that our data roughly takes the shape of the linearithmic parent function. 
We included in our data points every ten values from 1 to 991, inclusive, as well as several much, much larger values (for good measure).

The regressions calculated by desmos appear to support our hypothesis as well as the statement that the algorithm is O(n).

Our full dataset is included as data.csv . Unfortunately we were not able to run the algorithm on lists of size greater than 10000000. Java would run out of memory.

### Conclusion: 

Hypothesis not rejected, MergeSort is likely nlog(n).
